// Personas demo — TOPIC CONTEXTS.
//
// A rate-limited persona is bound to a topic:
//
//     persona = H(sk || context || i),   i < MAX_PSEUDO
//
// so the same member has unlinkable petnames across topics, and at most MAX_PSEUDO
// identities within any one topic. The `context` is what makes that work, and every
// member of the group must agree on the same number for the same topic.
//
// The design calls for the CryptoPersonas server to draw that number at random, store
// it per thread, and hand it to clients. No such server exists in this architecture —
// the ZK engine runs client-side in each Desktop instance, and `deploy/` has only the
// Signal chat test-server and the storage-service. So the number is drawn CLIENT-side
// here and distributed over Signal itself:
//
//   1. the creator draws a cryptographically random context,
//   2. broadcasts a topic ANNOUNCEMENT to the group (`PZT2:` carriage, hidden from the
//      timeline like the other protocol traffic),
//   3. every member ingests it into this registry.
//
// Sending it over Signal rather than through the roster dir is deliberate: the roster
// dir is a local directory, so it only works when every instance is on one machine.
// Announcements ride the group, so the demo works across machines.
//
// A topic announcement is NOT a ZK record. It carries no proof and the engine never
// sees it — it is pure coordination metadata, the stand-in for the server's registry.
// Everything funnels through `resolveTopicContext`, so pointing this at a real server
// endpoint later is a one-function change.
//
// KNOWN LIMIT: a member who joins after a topic was announced will not have it, since
// there is no backfill. Re-announcing on join, or a server registry, would fix it.
