// The badge REQUEST -> ADMIN APPROVAL -> SCAN flow.
//
// A badge differs from everything else in this demo in one important way: it is the only
// claim that needs a second party. A pseudonym, an authorship proof and a reputation
// score are all statements about your own keys, so you can produce them alone. A badge
// says "someone vouched for me", so somebody else has to act.
//
// The protocol path, all of which already exists:
//
//   1. requester emits `Record::BadgeRequest`, which FILES A CALLBACK. The callback is
//      the thing approval invokes — without it there would be nothing to approve.
//   2. an admin emits `Record::BadgeApprove` naming the request's envelope hash. Its
//      accept rule marks the requester's ticket with the approved slot.
//   3. at the next settlement barrier the replica invokes that ticket with
//      BADGE1/2/3_FLAG — the same machinery that invokes BAN_FLAG for a ban.
//   4. the requester's next SCAN absorbs it, and the circuit writes the badge into
//      their own user object (`standard_callback_method`).
//   5. only then can they prove possession with `badge_pred`.
//
// So a badge is not granted at approval time. It lands at the requester's next scan,
// exactly like a ban — and the UI has to say so, because "approved" and "usable" are
// several seconds and one scan apart.
//
// BOTH RECORDS RIDE THE SHARED PHANTOM, so neither the requester nor the approver is
// named on the wire.
//
// They started out attributable, on the argument that "a request is a person asking a
// human to vouch for them, which cannot be done anonymously". That argument was wrong
// about this protocol. Look at steps 1-4 above: the grant travels by CALLBACK. The
// approval names a ticket, the replica invokes it, the requester absorbs it because they
// alone hold the secret. Identity never enters the chain, so attributing the envelope
// was leaking something nothing used.
//
// THE COST, which is real: an admin approves "a request for Faculty", not "Bob's
// request". They cannot recognise who they are vouching for. If person-specific
// vouching turns out to be required, the fix is to change the marker back in
// personasCarriage.std.ts — deliberately, and knowing what it reveals — not to relabel
// the bubble.
