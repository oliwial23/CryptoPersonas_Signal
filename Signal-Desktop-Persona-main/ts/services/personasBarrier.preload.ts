// Personas demo — the SHARED BARRIER SCHEDULE, one per personas group.
//
// A replica only crosses a settlement barrier when told to. Across N Desktop instances
// that has to happen at the same points in the record stream, or replica roots diverge;
// and it has to happen on time even in a silent group, or a ban poll never settles.
//
// The engine already has the fix: construct it with `heartbeatAnchorMs` +
// `heartbeatPeriodMs` and every replica buckets an ingest onto a barrier derived from a
// timestamp every recipient sees identically, instead of local arrival order.
// `tick(nowMs)` then advances to the barrier the same schedule says wall-clock has
// reached.
//
// Each group's schedule is fixed by its PHANTOM BUNDLE: the member who minted the bundle
// picked it, and every member that holds the bundle agrees on it with nothing shared but
// the bundle itself. A group with no bundle has no engine, and so no schedule.
