//! The serverless headless client (workstream **d4**).
//!
//! d3 built the [`Replica`]: ingest an ordered log of record *bytes*, apply the
//! deterministic accept rule, converge on the same bulletin as everyone else. d4 is
//! what makes that a **messenger** — it ties a [`Transport`] (the mock today, real
//! Signal under e2) to a replica:
//!
//! - records ride as chat messages ([`carriage`]);
//! - incoming messages are decoded and [`ingest`](Replica::ingest)ed, and the
//!   accepted log [`render`](render)ed as `~petname: message`;
//! - a co-located [`Member`] produces the records this client sends, proving against
//!   the replica's **own** Merkle trees (`SERVERLESS_PROTOCOL.md` §5);
//! - a late joiner adopts a [`Snapshot`] from their inviter, TOFU-pinned (§12).
//!
//! `Messenger` is where the send and receive halves meet. It is generic over the
//! three d1 tree heights, defaulting to the production heights; tests instantiate it
//! at tiny heights with in-process keygen, exactly as d3's do.
//!
//! # What d4 leaves to its neighbours
//!
//! - The barrier **cadence** — when [`barrier`](Messenger::barrier) fires — is d5.
//!   d4 exposes the trigger; d5 decides the heartbeat.
//! - `FoldScan` is off by default (§13); the [`carriage`] attachment path exists for
//!   it but nothing on the demo path produces one.
//! - The optimistic-object **re-base** loop (§13/O2) is `Member`'s noted seam: this
//!   client posts one interaction at a time and lets it land.
