//! A fixed-height, append-only (incremental) binary Merkle tree over Poseidon.
//!
//! This is the native (out-of-circuit) half of the serverless object bulletin.
//! It is deliberately the *same* hash the rest of the system commits with —
//! [`Poseidon<2>`] as a 2-to-1 compression function — so a root computed here
//! is the root the in-circuit gadget ([`super::gadget`]) recomputes, and both
//! match what zk-callbacks hashes elsewhere.
//!
//! # Structure
//!
//! The tree has a fixed `HEIGHT`, giving `2^HEIGHT` leaf slots filled
//! left-to-right. Empty slots hash as a fixed sentinel (`F::zero`), and an
//! empty subtree of level `l` has the precomputed hash `zeros[l]`
//! (`zeros[0] = 0`, `zeros[l+1] = H(zeros[l], zeros[l])`). This is the standard
//! Tornado/Semaphore incremental-tree construction: an append touches only the
//! `HEIGHT` nodes on the new leaf's path, so both append and witness lookup are
//! `O(HEIGHT)`.
//!
//! # Why append-only is sound with a *buffered* root (the O10 lesson)
//!
//! Membership of an append-only set is **monotone**: once a leaf is in the tree
//! it stays in, and no later append can evict it. So a witness against a
//! slightly stale root is still a valid witness against a newer root's history
//! — a replica may safely accept membership proofs against any recent root it
//! has itself computed (a ring buffer of the last K roots). This is the exact
//! opposite of callback *non*membership, which is anti-monotone and must pin the
//! current epoch's root only — see [`super::callback`]. Rewind is blocked not by
//! the root but by the nullifier set (`has_never_received_nul`).
