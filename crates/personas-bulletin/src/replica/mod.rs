//! The serverless replica engine (workstream **d3**).
//!
//! Every member runs a replica. The group chat is an ordered log of [`Record`]s;
//! each replica ingests it, applies the same deterministic accept rule, and
//! thereby computes the same bulletin. *The accept rule is the protocol*
//! (`docs/SERVERLESS_PROTOCOL.md` §1). This module is that rule, and the state it
//! maintains: the d1 Merkle object and callback trees, the nullifier set, the
//! poll/rating tallies, the outstanding-ticket settlement set, and the persona
//! cache — all derived from the log, none of it trusted from a peer.
//!
//! # Why it recomputes rather than mutates forward
//!
//! Convergence (§1) is the whole game: two replicas that have ingested the *same*
//! records must compute the *same* roots, or they have forked. Arrival order is
//! adversarial — the messenger may deliver a member's second post before their
//! first — so the engine cannot simply append as records land. The d1 object tree
//! is append-*order*-sensitive (d1 §assumption 5 punts the ordering to here), so a
//! convergent replica must impose a **canonical** order independent of arrival.
//!
//! The canonical order is §4's: **prefix (causal) order, tiebroken by ascending
//! envelope hash.** A record names the object root it was built on (§5.1), which
//! is a commitment to the prefix accepted before it, so "root `r` was produced" is
//! the causal predicate and the smaller `eh` wins a genuine tie. The engine
//! realises this by *replaying the whole seen set* on each change: at each barrier
//! it repeatedly applies the smallest-`eh` record whose named root it has already
//! produced, until none remain. This is a deterministic function of (the record
//! set, the per-record first-seen barrier, the current barrier) — so replicas that
//! saw the same records under the same barrier schedule converge exactly, and the
//! rest converge as the schedule catches up (§5.2's transient-then-closed
//! divergence). Groth16 verification is memoised by `eh` (a proof's validity
//! against the root it names is a fixed fact), so replay costs one verification per
//! record, not one per rebuild.
//!
//! Replaying from genesis on every change is quadratic in practice: the cost grows with
//! (records × barriers), and the messenger rebuilds on every ingest *and* every
//! heartbeat. So the rebuild is checkpointed: the state at the end of each recent
//! barrier is kept, and a change replays only from the first barrier it can affect —
//! a record first seen at barrier `f` cannot influence barriers before `f`, because the
//! accept loop at barrier `b` only considers records with `first_barrier <= b`. Crossing
//! a barrier with no new record processes just that barrier. The result is the same
//! deterministic function as a full replay (the test build asserts this on every
//! incremental rebuild); only records older than the checkpoint window fall back to one.
//!
//! # The root discipline (the security claim d1 rests on)
//!
//! d1 §assumption 3: *the replica pins a root it derived itself, never a root from
//! a proof or a peer.* Here that is literal. An object proof is verified against
//! `Some(root)` where `root` is one this replica produced (§5.1, monotone — any
//! recent produced root is safe, held in a window of the last `K`). A scan's
//! callback roots are the replica's **own current-barrier** roots, rebuilt from
//! its own called set (§5.2, anti-monotone — the latest barrier only, no grace);
//! a scan naming a superseded barrier simply has no matching root and is rejected.
//! That is the structural O10 fix carried into the engine.
//!
//! # Scope (d3)
//!
//! Built here: the accept rules for every [`Record`] kind; the object-root window;
//! nullifier-first-wins; the barriers ([`Replica::advance_to`]) that fire the
//! **derived** triggers (poll-ban close and reputation settlement, §7) and re-pin the
//! callback root; the tallies and persona cache; view digests and claims (§5.5); and
//! append-only journal persistence. The messenger receive loop, rendering and late
//! join live in `personas-messenger`, and the heartbeat that drives the barriers in
//! its `Heartbeat`. `FoldScan` is off by default (§13).
//!
//! The *authorized* triggers are not authenticated here. An admin [`Record::Ban`] and
//! [`Record::RejoinApprove`] are accepted by the client only from a Signal group admin
//! (they travel under the admin's own account), and a [`Record::BadgeApprove`] is not
//! checked at all; see its docs. The signed authority keys of §7/§11 are not built.
